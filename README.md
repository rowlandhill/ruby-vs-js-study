# Ruby vs. JavaScript: Study

You've already learned the basics of programming with JavaScript and you've
begun to think like a problem-solver. You've had practice reading JavaScript
code and predicting execution by evaluating expressions in your mind.

We'll continue to reinforce the basics of programming, but this time with Ruby.
This may seem like a lot of material to cover in a short time, but the truth is
that our task is simpler than it was when we introduced JavaScript. Instead of
teaching you how to program, we'll focus on the *differences* between Ruby and
JavaScript with the goal of utilizing the foundation we've already built.

## Prerequisites

-   [JavaScript Basics](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-basics)
-   [JavaScript Reference Types](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-reference-types)
-   [Ruby](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Compare and contrast Ruby's and Node.js's REPL/interpreter.
-   Compare and contrast Ruby's and JavaScript's basic language features and
    types.
-   Understand the core differences between Ruby and JavaScript
