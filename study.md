# Ruby versus Javascript Study

Use your favorite search engine and any other resources to research and

## Ruby Versus Javascript :: String Interpolation

What is another, perhaps more DRY-compliant way to write this in Ruby?

Experiment in pry and place your answer below.

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> name = "Jason"
=> "Jason" [2] pry(main)> age = 28
=> 35
[3] pry(main)> name + " is " + age.to_s + " years old."
=> "Jason is 28 years old."
```

## Ruby vs. Javascript :: String Methods

1. Open pry in your terminal and input `str = "ylbmessa lareneg`
2. With what you now know about ruby methods, reverse the string so that the output reads `"general assembly"` change the string into an array of characters so that the ouput reads : `["g", "e", "n", "e", "r", "a", "l", " ", "a", "s", "s", "e", "m", "b", "l", "y"]`
3. Then change your new array back into a string with hyphens in between characters so that your result is `"g-e-n-e-r-a-l- -a-s-s-e-m-b-l-y"`.
4. Even better if you can do so while removing the two `- -`'s between `general` and `assembly`
