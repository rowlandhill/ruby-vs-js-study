## Required Readings

-   [Ruby vs JavaScript](http://agentcooper.io/js-ruby-comparison/)

## Ruby vs. JavaScript: Compare and Contrast

Describe three examples of differences between Ruby and JavaScript.

```md
1) You do not need to declare a variable in Ruby like you do in JavaScript. It's implied in Ruby.
2) Ruby uses "do" and "end" as blocks for multi-line code, as opposed to {} in JS
3) You can count backwards from the end of an array, which makes it easier to find the length of an array and make
changes to a changing array.
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript: Type Conversion

Type conversion in Ruby is invoked by calling methods like `to_i` (to integer),
`to_f` (to float), and `to_s` (to string).  Here is some Ruby code that
declares two variables `left_operand` and `right_operand` to the strings `1` and
`2`, respectively.  It then declares a variable called `sum` that converts both
`left_operand` and `right_operand` to integers to add them.

```ruby
left_operand = '1'
right_operand = '2'

sum = left_operand.to_i + right_operand.to_i
# sum: 3
```

Write some JavaScript code that duplicates this functionality.

```javascript
const add = function (a, b) {
  return parseInt(a) + parseInt(b)
}

add(1, 2)
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript: String Interpolation

String interpolation in JavaScript is performed by wrapping a string with accent
graves (\`) rather than single quotation marks (') or double quotation marks
(").  For example,

```javascript
const beverage = 'tea'

console.log(`Many people drink ${beverage}.`)
// Output: Many people like to drink tea.
```

Write some Ruby code to duplicate this functionality.

```ruby
beverage = "tea"
puts "Many people drink #{beverage}"
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript: Array and String Methods

Use what you know about Ruby to do some string manipulation.  If you need to
look up Ruby's array and string methods, then check the
[Array](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Array.html) and
[String](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/String.html) articles on
[Ruby-Doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org).

1.  Open `pry` in your terminal and set a variable, `str`, to `"eeffoc"`.
1.  Reverse the string so that the output reads `"coffee"`.
1.  Change the string into an array of characters so that the output reads
    `["c", "o", "f", "f", "e", "e"]`.
1.  Change your new array back into a string with hyphens in between characters
    so that your result is `"c-o-f-f-e-e"`.

```ruby
str = "eeffoc"
str.reverse
str.reverse.split("")
str.join.scan(/.{1}|.+/).join("-")
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript: Classes and Instantiation

Ruby has classes just like JavaScript, but while JavaScript uses prototypal
inheritance, Ruby uses class-based inheritance.  Here is some Ruby code that
declares a class called Person that takes an argument, `name`, upon
instantiation and sets it as an instance variable.  It also has a method named
`hello` that outputs a string to the console.

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def hello
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name}."
  end
end

boomhauer = Person.new('Jeff Boomhauer')

boomhauer.hello
# Output: Hello, my name is Jeff Boomhauer.
```

Write some JavaScript code that duplicates this functionality.

```javascript
You must be the only person alive who can understand Boomhauer

const Person = function (name) {
  this.name = name
}

const hello = function (name) {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name)
}

// I'm not sure


```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript: Blocks and Callbacks, Part I

In Ruby, blocks are like anonymous functions that can be passed into methods,
but cannot be referenced again later on; similar to callback functions in
JavaScript.  Here is some Ruby code that takes an array of natural numbers and
filters out the ones that are not multiples of 3.

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

filtered_numbers = numbers.select { |number| number % 3 == 0 }
# filtered_numbers: [3, 6, 9]
```

Write some JavaScript code that uses the array `filter()` method to duplicate
this functionality.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

const filteredNumbersss = numbers.filter(function(array) {
  for (let i = 0; array.length < 10; i++)
  if (i % 3 === 0)
  return i
})

// i'm not sure about this one either
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript: Blocks and Callbacks, Part II

Here is some JavaScript code that takes an array of natural numbers and uses
`map()` to create a new array containing the squares of `numbers`.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

const squares = numbers.map(number => {
  return number ** 2
})

// squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

Write some Ruby code that uses the Array `map` method and code blocks to
duplicate this functionality.

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

squares = numbers.map { |number, i| number ** 2 }
```
